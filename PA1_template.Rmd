This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The variables included in this dataset are:
  
steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA )
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

## 1. Loading and Pre-Processing Data

First,remove all variables from the environment

```{r}
#removes all variables from environment
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))
```

Next, download the dataset required for this assignment. Description of this data from course website:
  
  This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day.

date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken


### 1.1. Loading the data

Reading the data into R into a dataframe and inspect the structure of the data

```{r}
dat = read.csv("C:/Users/Mandeep/Desktop/AMD/RepData_PeerAssessment1/activity/activity.csv", header = T)
names(dat)
head(dat)
```

### 1.2. Data Pre-Processing

For classes for each feature in our data frame

```{r}
str(dat)
```

##  2.  Mean of Total Number of Steps Taken per day

 - Histogram,
 - Mean & 
 - Median

### 2.1.  Calculating Total Number of Steps Taken per day

 - Group data 
 - Summarise the data using the sum of all the steps taken, by total number of steps taken each day.
 - Ignore missing values 
 - Test the final result Eg :- Using head() and loading first 10 rows

```{r}
library(data.table)
dat_tbl = data.table(dat)
dat_tbl_summary = dat_tbl[, list(total_steps = sum(steps, na.rm = T)), 
                          by = date]
```

### 2.2.  Histogram for Total Number of Steps Taken each Day

Below is a histogram addresses the following items:
  
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day

Note: Mean and Median Are Reported In Legend Of Histogram

## Making The Generation of This Plot Into A Function So I Can Re-use Later

#### caluclate mean and median

```{r, echo=TRUE}
gen_hist = function(x, title){
  hist(x, 
       breaks = 20,
       main = title,
       xlab = 'Total Number of Steps', col = 'grey',
       cex.main = .9)

mean_value = round(mean(x), 1)
median_value = round(median(x), 1)

#place lines for mean and median on histogram

abline(v=mean_value, lwd = 3, col = 'blue')
abline(v=median_value, lwd = 3, col = 'red')

#create legend

legend('topright', lty = 1, lwd = 3, col = c("blue", "red"),
         cex = .8, 
         legend = c(paste('Mean: ', mean_value),
                    paste('Median: ', median_value))
  )
}
```
 
### 2.3. Reporting the Mean and Median of the Total Number of Steps taken per Day

```{r, echo=TRUE}
gen_hist(dat_tbl_summary$total_steps, 'Number of Steps Taken Per Day')
```

##  3.  Calculating Average of Daily Activity Pattern  

###  3.1.  Making Time Series Plot  

Next, Try to visualize the daily activity pattern

The below plot addresses the following items:
 
- Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") using the 5-minute inverval(x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days(y-axis).
- Regroup our data using the identifier of the 5-minute interval
- Summarise data, obtaining the average number of steps, across all days, for each interval.
- Ignore missing values at this point.

#### Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

```{r}
#summarize dataset by interval
dat_tbl_summary_intv = dat_tbl[, list(avg_steps = mean(steps, na.rm = T)), 
                               by = interval]
```

#### plot the time series

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#plot the time series
with(dat_tbl_summary_intv, {
  plot(interval, avg_steps, type = 'l',
       main = 'Average Steps by Time Interval',
       xlab = '5 Minute Time Interval',
       ylab = 'Average Number of Steps')
})

#### 3.2. To Identify 5-minute Interval containing Maximum number of Steps

#### - Line containing maximum value
#### - Subset Dataframe

max_steps = dat_tbl_summary_intv[which.max(avg_steps), ]

#### Generate Label String

max_lab = paste('Maximum Of ', round(max_steps$avg_steps, 1), ' Steps \n On ', max_steps$interval, 'th Time Interval', sep = '')

#### Collect Cooridinates of The Max Interval For Graphing

points(max_steps$interval,  max_steps$avg_steps, col = 'red', lwd = 3, pch = 19)

#### Add Label To Annotate Maximum # Steps And Interval

legend("topright",
       legend = max_lab,
       text.col = 'red',
       bty = 'n'
)
```


## 4. Input Missing Values    

### 4.1. Calculate & Report Total Number of Missing Values    

 sum(is.na(dat$steps))

Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.


### 4.2. Fill-in the Missing Values    

- Use mean for the 5-minute interval, as activity has highly variability throughout the day.
- Subset data to get a data frame with just incomplete cases.
- Join the resulting table with the average number of steps by interval and use it to fill the missing data.

Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.


- Creating New Dataset with no Missin values
- Replace the missing values in the original dataset with the values derived and replicate the original data in a new table.
- Then fill the missing values with the values from the new table.

#### First join the dataframe I created earlier that summarizes the average number of steps per interval to the original dataset

```{r}
setkey(dat_tbl, interval)
setkey(dat_tbl_summary_intv, interval)
```

#### Create function that will return the second value if the first value is NA
```{r}
NA_replace = function(x,y){
  if(is.na(x)){
    
    return(y)
  }
  return(x)
}
```

#### create new dataset that replaces NAs with average values
```{r}
dat_tbl_miss = dat_tbl[dat_tbl_summary_intv]
dat_tbl_miss$new_steps = mapply(NA_replace,dat_tbl_miss$steps, dat_tbl_miss$avg_steps)
```

### 4.3. Measuring Impact of Filled in Missing Values

#### summarize new dataset by day
```{r}
dat_tbl_summary_miss = dat_tbl_miss[, list(new_steps = sum(new_steps, na.rm = T)), 
                                    by = date]
```

#### preview new dataset
```{r}
head(dat_tbl_summary_miss)
```

Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of inputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

Note: Mean and Median Are Reported In Legend Of Histogram

- total steps for these days = equal to the daily mean  
- Effect of Mean and Median

```{r, echo=TRUE}
gen_hist(dat_tbl_summary$total_steps, 'Missing Values Removed')
gen_hist(dat_tbl_summary_miss$new_steps, 'Missing Values Replaced With \n Mean For Interval')
```

Answer To Question: The mean and the median are now almost the same after replacing missing values with the mean value for the relevant interval. It makes sense that the median value would now move closer to the mean. So the Median value increased after this method of missing value replacement.
Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

- Variability decreased and the distribution appears to be "thinner", converging towards the center.This happens because missing values appear in missing days: entire days for which there is no data.Since we are replacing entire days with the same values, this will lead to these days having the equal total steps.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

- After filling in the missing data, the mean holds the same value while the median converged to the mean.

## 5. To determine for any Differences in Activity Pattern between Weekdays and Weekends

- To explore the differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends.
- Use the filled-in missing values for this part.

### 5.1. Creating New Factor Variable in Dataset 

#### Make Function To Return Either "Weekday" or "Weekend"
```{r}
weekpart = function(x){
  if(x %in% c('Saturday', 'Sunday')){
    return('Weekend')
  }
  
  return('Weekday')
}
```

#### Add Name of Week
```{r}
dat_tbl_miss$dayname = weekdays(as.Date(dat_tbl_miss$date))
```

- Concluding this, convert the new column from character to factor.
#### Add Factor Variable To Differentiate Weekday and Weekend
```{r}
dat_tbl_miss$daytype = as.factor(apply(as.matrix(dat_tbl_miss$dayname), 1, weekpart))
```

#### Summarize Dataset: Mean grouped by interval and daytype
```{r}
dat_tbl_summary_miss = dat_tbl_miss[, list(avg_steps = mean(new_steps, na.rm = T)), 
                                     by = list(interval, daytype)]
```

#### Inspect dataset
```{r}
str(dat_tbl_summary_miss)
```


### 5.2. Making Panel Plot containing Time Series

- Get data
- Additional feature - weekdays

Below is the panel plot:
 
```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(lattice)
xyplot(avg_steps~interval | daytype, data = dat_tbl_summary_miss,
       type = 'l',
       xlab = 'Interval',
       ylab = 'Number of Steps',
       layout = c(1,2))
```


### The activity patterns are effectively distinct for weekdays and weekend days.

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
